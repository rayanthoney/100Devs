// Stepping Through Recursive Fibonacci Function (#kyu)

// Instructions 
// The Fibonacci numbers, commonly denoted F(n) form a sequence, called the Fibonacci sequence, such that each number is the sum of the two preceding ones, starting from 0 and 1. That is,

```js
    F(0) = 0, F(1) = 1
    F(n) = F(n - 1) + F(n - 2), for n > 1.
    Given n, calculate F(n).

    Example 1:

    Input: n = 2
    Output: 1
    Explanation: F(2) = F(1) + F(0) = 1 + 0 = 1.
    Example 2:

    Input: n = 3
    Output: 2
    Explanation: F(3) = F(2) + F(1) = 1 + 1 = 2.
    Example 3:

    Input: n = 4
    Output: 3
    Explanation: F(4) = F(3) + F(2) = 2 + 1 = 3.
