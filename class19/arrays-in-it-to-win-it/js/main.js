//Create an array of movies with at least three movies.
let movies = ["Shrek1", "Shrek2", "Shrek3"];

//Using the array from above, store the first movie in a variable
let firstMovie = movies[0];
//Get the length of the original array and store it in a new variable
let arrLength = movies.length;
console.log(s.length);
//Get the last element in that array and store it in a new variable. What if your array was really large and you didn't know the last index? Would your solution still work?
let lastElement = movies[2];

let lastElement = movies[movies.length - 1];
