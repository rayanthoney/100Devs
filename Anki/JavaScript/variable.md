# Variables ðŸ§ 

## Explain what a Variable is?

- Explanation:

A Variable is like containers that hold a value or a labled box that stores information that can be accessed and manipulated throughout the code! To create a Variable in JavaScript, use a keyword ie var, let, const. A name ie myVariable and a value = 5.

- Example:

```js
    var myVariable = 5; // define the variable and assign the value.
    let myVariable = 5; // define the variable and assign the value.
    const myVariable = 5; // define the variable and assign the value.
```

## What is a Variable Keyword used for?

- Explanation:

In JavaScript Variables can be declared using one of the Keywords var, let, or const, followed by a variable name and an optional initial value.

- Example:

```js
    var myVariable = 5; // define the variable and assign the value.
    let myVariable = 5; // define the variable and assign the value.
    const myVariable = 5; // define the variable and assign the value.
```

## What is a Variable Name used for?

- Explanation:

Variable names in JavaScript should be descriptive, using camelCase or snake_case, and should not start with a number or use reserved keywords.

- Example:

```js
    var myVariable = 5; // define the variable and assign the value.
    let myVariable = 5; // define the variable and assign the value.
    const myVariable = 5; // define the variable and assign the value.
```

## What is a Variable Value used for?

- Explanation:

In JavaScript, you can assign a value to a variable using the = operator. Variables can hold numeric values, including integers and decimals, string values, which are collections of characters enclosed in quotes, Boolean values, which represent true or false, special values such as null or undefined, which indicate that the variable has no value or has not been assigned a value yet, more complex data structures such as objects and arrays, which can store multiple values and properties,

- Example:

```js
    let price = 9.99; // Numeric
    let message = "Hello, world!"; // String
    let isFalse = false; // Boolean
    let noValue = null; // Null
    let person = {
    name: "John",
    age: 30,
    city: "New York",
    }; // Object
    let fruits = ["apple", "banana", "orange"]; // Arrays
```

## What is a Variable Constants used for?

- Explanation

Variables declared with const cannot be reassigned, but their properties can be modified if they are objects or arrays.

- Example

```js
const myBirthday = "18.04.1982";

myBirthday = "01.01.2001"; // error, can't reassign the constant!
```
