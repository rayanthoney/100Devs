## Describe a _Variable_

> You use variables as symbolic names for values in your application. The names of variables, called identifiers, conform to certain rules.

> A JavaScript identifier usually starts with a letter, underscore (_), or dollar sign ($). Subsequent characters can also be digits (0 – 9). Because JavaScript is case sensitive, letters include the characters A through Z (uppercase) as well as a through z (lowercase).

```js

var Declares a variable, optionally initializing it to a value.

let Declares a block-scoped, local variable, optionally initializing it to a value.

const Declares a block-scoped, read-only named constant.
