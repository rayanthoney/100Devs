# Algorithms

## What are **Algorithms**

> A process or set of rules to be followed in calculations or other problem-solving operations, especially by a computer

## What is **pseudocode**

> Pseudocode is a step by step break down of the whole process into actionable steps
> The most optimal solution will thus be one that consumes minimal energy and takes little time to complete the task.

## What is the definition of **Mutable**

> A mutable value is one that can be changed without creating an entirely new value. In JavaScript, objects and arrays are mutable by default, but primitive values are not â€” once a primitive value is created, it cannot be changed, although the variable that holds it may be reassigned.
> 
> Example:: 
>
   > "let" -> is **Mutable** and allows a variable in JavaScript to be changed. 
   >
   > "const" -> is **Imutable** variable in JavaScipt can not be changed.
