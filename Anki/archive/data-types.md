# Data Types 🧠

## What are **Data Types**?

> Data types are the classifications we give to the different kinds of data that we use in programming. In JavaScript, there are seven fundamental data types:.
- Number: Any number, including numbers with decimals: 4, 8, 1516, 23.42.String: Any grouping of characters on your keyboard (letters, numbers, spaces, symbols, etc.) surrounded by single quotes: ' ... ' or double quotes " ... ", though we prefer single quotes. Some people like to think of string as a fancy word for text.
- Boolean: This data type only has two possible values— either true or false (without quotes). It’s helpful to think of booleans as on and off switches or as the answers to a “yes” or “no” question.
- Null: This data type represents the intentional absence of a value, and is represented by the keyword null (without quotes).
- Undefined: This data type is denoted by the keyword undefined (without quotes). It also represents the absence of a value though it has a different use than null. undefined means that a given value does not exist.
- Symbol: A newer feature to the language, symbols are unique identifiers, useful in more complex coding. No need to worry about these for now.
- Object: Collections of related data.
