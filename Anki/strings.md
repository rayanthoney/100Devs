# Interview (Strings)

## What is the **String.length** method?

> The length read-only method of a string contains the length of the string in UTF-16 code units.

```js
const str = "Life, the universe and everything. Answer:";

console.log(`${str} ${str.length}`);
// expected output: "Life, the universe and everything. Answer: 42"
```

## What is the **String.prototype.trim()** method?

> The trim() method removes whitespace from both ends of a string and returns a new string, without modifying the original string. Whitespace in this context is all the whitespace characters (space, tab, no-break space, etc.) and all the line terminator characters (LF, CR, etc.).

```js
const greeting = "   Hello world!   ";

console.log(greeting);
// expected output: "   Hello world!   ";

console.log(greeting.trim());
// expected output: "Hello world!";
```

## What is the String.prototype.includes() method?

> The includes() method performs a case-sensitive search to determine whether one string may be found within another string, returning true or false as appropriate.

```js
const sentence = "The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog.";

const word = "fox";

console.log(
  `The word "${word}" ${
    sentence.includes(word) ? "is" : "is not"
  } in the sentence`
);
// expected output: "The word "fox" is in the sentence"
```

## What is String.prototype.toUpperCase() method?

> The toUpperCase() method returns the calling string value converted to uppercase (the value will be converted to a string if it isn't one).

```js
const sentence = "The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog.";

console.log(sentence.toUpperCase());
// expected output: "THE QUICK BROWN FOX JUMPS OVER THE LAZY DOG."
```

```js
const str = "We are some small letters that want to be big";
console.log(str.toUpperCase()); // 'WE ARE SOME SMALL LETTERS THAT WANT TO BE BIG'
```

## What is String.prototype.toLowerCase() method?

> The toLowerCase() method returns the calling string value converted to lower case.

```js
const sentence = "The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog.";

console.log(sentence.toLowerCase());
// expected output: "the quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog."
```

```js
const str = "This has BIG LETTERS. They want to all be small.";
console.log(str.toUpperCase()); // "this has big letters, they want to all be small."
```

## What is String.prototype.replace() method?

> The replace() method returns a new string with one, some, or all matches of a pattern replaced by a replacement. The pattern can be a string or a RegExp, and the replacement can be a string or a function called for each match. If pattern is a string, only the first occurrence will be replaced. The original string is left unchanged.

```js
const p =
  "The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog. If the dog reacted, was it really lazy?";

console.log(p.replace("dog", "monkey"));
// expected output: "The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy monkey. If the dog reacted, was it really lazy?"

const regex = /Dog/i;
console.log(p.replace(regex, "ferret"));
// expected output: "The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy ferret. If the dog reacted, was it really lazy?"
```

```js
const str = "Hello world! My name is also world. How funny.";
const stringPattern = "world";
const regexPattern = /world/gi;
const replacement = "gitconnected";

console.log(str.replace(stringPattern, replacement));
// returned output: "Hello gitconnected! My name is also world. How funny."
console.log(str.replace(regexPattern, replacement));
// returned output:  "Hello gitconnected! My name is also gitconnected. How funny."
```

## What is **String.prototype.slice()** method?

> The slice() method extracts a section of a string and returns it as a new string, without modifying the original string.

```js
const str = "The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog.";

console.log(str.slice(31));
// expected output: "the lazy dog."

console.log(str.slice(4, 19));
// expected output: "quick brown fox"

console.log(str.slice(-4));
// expected output: "dog."

console.log(str.slice(-9, -5));
// expected output: "lazy"
```

> _slice()_ takes the beginning index as the first parameter and an optional ending index as the second parameter â€” str.slice(beginIndex[, endIndex]). If no ending index is supplied, it slices to the end of the string starting with your beginIndex. If a negative beginIndex is used, it will slice backwards from the end of the string. The following is an example from [MDN](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/String/slice) which depicts these cases.

```js
var str = "The quick red fox jumped over the lazy dogs's back.";

console.log(str.slice(30));
// expected output: "the lazy dog's back."

console.log(str.slice(4, 17));
// expected output: "quick red fox."

console.log(str.slice(str.slice));
// expected output: "back"

console.log(str.slice(-11, -6));
// expected output: "dogs"
```

## What is **String.prototype.split()** method?

> The split() method takes a pattern and divides a String into an ordered list of substrings by searching for the pattern, puts these substrings into an array, and returns the array.

```js
const str = "The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog.";

const words = str.split(" ");
console.log(words[3]);
// expected output: "fox"

const chars = str.split("");
console.log(chars[8]);
// expected output: "k"

const strCopy = str.split();
console.log(strCopy);
// expected output: Array ["The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog."]
```

## What is **String.prototype.repeat()** method?

> The repeat() method constructs and returns a new string which contains the specified number of copies of the string on which it was called, concatenated together.

```js
const chorus = "Because I'm happy. ";

console.log(`Chorus lyrics for "Happy": ${chorus.repeat(27)}`);

// expected output: "Chorus lyrics for "Happy": Because I'm happy. Because I'm happy. Because I'm happy. Because I'm happy. Because I'm happy. Because I'm happy. Because I'm happy. Because I'm happy. Because I'm happy. Because I'm happy. Because I'm happy. Because I'm happy. Because I'm happy. Because I'm happy. Because I'm happy. Because I'm happy. Because I'm happy. Because I'm happy. Because I'm happy. Because I'm happy. Because I'm happy. Because I'm happy. Because I'm happy. Because I'm happy. Because I'm happy. Because I'm happy. Because I'm happy. "
```

```js
const str = "Hello World ðŸ˜Ž. ";
console.log(str.repeat(3)); // "Hello World ðŸ˜Ž .  "Hello World ðŸ˜Ž .  "Hello World ðŸ˜Ž . "
```

## What is **String.prototype.match()** method?

> The match() method retrieves the result of matching a string against a regular expression.

```js
const paragraph = "The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog. It barked.";
const regex = /[A-Z]/g;
const found = paragraph.match(regex);

console.log(found);
// expected output: Array ["T", "I"]
```

## What is **String.prototype.charAt()** method?

> The String object's charAt() method returns a new string consisting of the single UTF-16 code unit located at the specified offset into the string.

```js
const sentence = "The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog.";

const index = 4;

console.log(`The character at index ${index} is ${sentence.charAt(index)}`);
// expected output: "The character at index 4 is q"
```

## What is **String.prototype.charCodeAt()** method?

> The charCodeAt() method returns an integer between 0 and 65535 representing the UTF-16 code unit at the given index.

```js
const sentence = "The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog.";

const index = 4;

console.log(
  `The character code ${sentence.charCodeAt(
    index
  )} is equal to ${sentence.charAt(index)}`
);
// expected output: "The character code 113 is equal to q"
```

## What is the **String.prototype.concat()** method?

> The concat() method concatenates the string arguments to the calling string and returns a new string.

```js
const str1 = "Hello";
const str2 = "World";

console.log(str1.concat(" ", str2));
// expected output: "Hello World"

console.log(str2.concat(", ", str1));
// expected output: "World, Hello"
```

## What is the **String.prototype.indexOf()** method?

> The indexOf() method, given one argument: a substring to search for, searches the entire calling string, and returns the index of the first occurrence of the specified substring. Given a second argument: a number, the method returns the first occurrence of the specified substring at an index greater than or equal to the specified number.

```js
const paragraph =
  "The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog. If the dog barked, was it really lazy?";

const searchTerm = "dog";
const indexOfFirst = paragraph.indexOf(searchTerm);

console.log(
  `The index of the first "${searchTerm}" from the beginning is ${indexOfFirst}`
);
// expected output: "The index of the first "dog" from the beginning is 40"

console.log(
  `The index of the 2nd "${searchTerm}" is ${paragraph.indexOf(
    searchTerm,
    indexOfFirst + 1
  )}`
);
// expected output: "The index of the 2nd "dog" is 52"
```

## What is the **String.prototype.search()** method?

> The search() method executes a search for a match between a regular expression and this String object.

```js
const paragraph =
  "The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog. If the dog barked, was it really lazy?";

// any character that is not a word character or whitespace
const regex = /[^\w\s]/g;

console.log(paragraph.search(regex));
// expected output: 43

console.log(paragraph[paragraph.search(regex)]);
// expected output: "."
```

## What is the **String.prototype.substr()** method?

> The substr() method returns a portion of the string, starting at the specified index and extending for a given number of characters afterwards.

```js
const str = "Mozilla";

console.log(str.substr(1, 2));
// expected output: "oz"

console.log(str.substr(2));
// expected output: "zilla"
```
